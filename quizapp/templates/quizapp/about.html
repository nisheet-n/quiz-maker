		This is a quiz app in which the user can choose one out of four options for a question. At the end of
		submitting the answers, it displays the result. Multiple questions can be added to the quiz in the app so that
		the user can select which question he wants to take. The score is released based on attempted questions only.
		<br>
		To edit the questions, one needs to access the Django Admin panel. You can create a Django SuperUser from
		command prompt by typing "python manage.py createsuperuser" command inside the root directory of the project.
		<br>
		Also, there are social media buttons in the homepage so that the user can share with their friends.
